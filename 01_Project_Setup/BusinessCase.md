1. Background / Problem Statement
Entry-level project management candidates are often evaluated based on theoretical knowledge rather than demonstrated ability. Many candidates struggle to show practical experience in 
planning, tracking, and reporting projects in a structured way. As a result, hiring managers find it difficult to assess whether a candidate understands real project workflows beyond 
definitions and tools.


2. Proposed Solution
ProTrack Lite is a lightweight project management dashboard combined with documented planning artifacts. The project involves planning and managing the development of the dashboard 
itself and then using it to track a simulated project. This approach provides visible proof of project management skills across the full project lifecycle.


3. Target Users / Beneficiaries
a. Hiring managers evaluating junior or entry-level project management candidates
b. Recruiters looking for practical PM portfolios
c. The project creator, as a learning and demonstration tool


4. Expected Value / Benefits
Demonstrates end-to-end project management skills (initiation to closure)
Provides tangible artifacts such as a project charter, risk register, and status reports
Shows ability to track timelines, risks, budget, and progress using a dashboard
Improves interview discussions by offering concrete examples instead of theory


5. Risk of Not Doing the Project
Without this project, the candidate would rely only on resumes and verbal explanations to demonstrate PM skills. This reduces visibility, limits differentiation from other candidates,
and weakens the ability to show structured thinking and real-world project handling.
